# CODSOFT Internship
Welcome to my repository documenting my journey through the CODSOFT virtual internship program! This internship spans over four weeks and consists of various projects aimed at enhancing skills in data science and machine learning.

## About CODSOFT
CODSOFT is a leading technology company known for its innovative solutions in software development and data analytics. The CODSOFT virtual internship program provides participants with hands-on experience in real-world projects, guided by industry experts and mentors.

## Internship Tasks
### Task 1: Movie Genre Prediction
In the first task of my internship, I worked on a project focused on movie genre prediction using the IMDb dataset. I utilized Python along with libraries such as sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, and numpy. The project involved converting textual data into numerical representations using TF-IDF and exploring different machine learning algorithms.

### Task 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection
For the second task, I successfully built a credit card fraud detection system using Python. I employed the Decision Tree algorithm for classification and implemented techniques like Standard Scaler and Label Encoder to enhance accuracy. The project aimed to detect fraudulent transactions effectively to ensure the security of credit card users.

### Task 3: SMS Spam Classifier
In this project, I tackled the challenge of building an SMS spam classifier. Leveraging Python and its libraries, I employed Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification, achieving remarkable accuracy. To further refine the model, I experimented with Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms, but SVM emerged as the optimal choice for its superior performance. Additionally, I utilized various libraries from NLTK such as word_tokenize, stopwords, and PorterStemmer to preprocess the text data effectively. This task not only honed my skills in machine learning but also deepened my understanding of natural language processing techniques.
